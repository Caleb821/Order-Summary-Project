## My process
I started with the HTML and made sure to create the proper divs to apply flexbox to elements. I started with <main> and worked from the outside in, attatching images changing to the right colors etc. I then styled the buttons, paragraph element and the center container. Then positioned the main content to the center of the page. Lastly I adjusted padding and margin to best resemble the project given

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my second actual HTML and CSS project, I definitely became more comfortable with flexbox and most of the CSS elements I used. More repetition will lead to this becoming easier.

### Continued development

I attempted to add a media query but was unsuccesful, but I later realized it wasn't necessary. Going forward however, I definitely plan to practice media queries so I can comfortably utilize them in the project
